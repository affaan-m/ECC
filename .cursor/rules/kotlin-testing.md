# Kotlin Testing

> This file extends the common testing rule with Kotlin-specific content.

## Framework

Use **Kotest** with spec styles (StringSpec, FunSpec, BehaviorSpec) and **MockK** for mocking.

## Coroutine Testing

Use `runTest` from `kotlinx-coroutines-test`:

```kotlin
test("async operation completes") {
    runTest {
        val result = service.fetchData()
        result.shouldNotBeEmpty()
    }
}
```

## Coverage

Use **Kover** for coverage reporting:

```bash
./gradlew koverHtmlReport
./gradlew koverVerify
```

## Reference

See skill: `kotlin-testing` for detailed Kotest patterns, MockK usage, and property-based testing.
