# PHP Patterns

> This file extends the common patterns rule with PHP specific content.

## Thin Controllers, Explicit Services

- Keep controllers focused on transport: auth, validation, serialization, status codes.
- Move business rules into application/domain services that are easy to test without HTTP bootstrapping.

## DTOs and Value Objects

- Replace shape-heavy associative arrays with DTOs for requests, commands, and external API payloads.
- Use value objects for money, identifiers, and constrained concepts.

## Dependency Injection

- Depend on interfaces or narrow service contracts, not framework globals.
- Pass collaborators through constructors so services are testable without service-locator lookups.
