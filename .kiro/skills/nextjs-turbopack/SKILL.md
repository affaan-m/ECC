# Next.js and Turbopack

Next.js 16+ uses Turbopack by default for local development: an incremental bundler written in Rust that significantly speeds up dev startup and hot updates.

## When to Use

- **Turbopack (default dev)**: Use for day-to-day development. Faster cold start and HMR, especially in large apps.
- **Webpack (legacy dev)**: Use only if you hit a Turbopack bug or rely on a webpack-only plugin in dev. Disable with `--webpack` (or `--no-turbopack` depending on your Next.js version; check the docs for your release).
- **Production**: Production build behavior (`next build`) may use Turbopack or webpack depending on Next.js version; check the official Next.js docs for your version.

Use when: developing or debugging Next.js 16+ apps, diagnosing slow dev startup or HMR, or optimizing production bundles.

## How It Works

- **Turbopack**: Incremental bundler for Next.js dev. Uses file-system caching so restarts are much faster (e.g. 5–14x on large projects).
- **Default in dev**: From Next.js 16, `next dev` runs with Turbopack unless disabled.
- **File-system caching**: Restarts reuse previous work; cache is typically under `.next`; no extra config needed for basic use.
- **Bundle Analyzer (Next.js 16.1+)**: Experimental Bundle Analyzer to inspect output and find heavy dependencies; enable via config or experimental flag (see Next.js docs for your version).

## Examples

### Commands

```bash
next dev
next build
next start
```

### Usage

Run `next dev` for local development with Turbopack. Use the Bundle Analyzer (see Next.js docs) to optimize code-splitting and trim large dependencies. Prefer App Router and server components where possible.

## Middleware File Naming

Next.js 16 introduced `proxy.ts` as the middleware filename, replacing the older `middleware.ts` convention:

- **Next.js 16+**: use `proxy.ts` at the project root
- **Pre-Next.js 16**: use `middleware.ts` at the project root

The filename change is tied to the **Next.js version**, not to which bundler (Turbopack or webpack) is in use. Always check the official docs for the version you are reviewing.

**Do not flag `proxy.ts` as a misnamed or missing middleware file in Next.js 16 projects.** The file is correct and intentional. Suggesting a rename to `middleware.ts` will break middleware execution.

## Best Practices

- Stay on a recent Next.js 16.x for stable Turbopack and caching behavior.
- If dev is slow, ensure you're on Turbopack (default) and that the cache isn't being cleared unnecessarily.
- For production bundle size issues, use the official Next.js bundle analysis tooling for your version.
